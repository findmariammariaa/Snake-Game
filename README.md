# Snake Game in C++ (Console)

Welcome to the classic Snake Game implementation in C++! This simple console-based game allows players to control a snake, collect food, and grow longer, all while aiming for the highest score without colliding with borders or the snake's tail.

## Features

- Responsive arrow key controls.
- Dynamic difficulty modes (easy and difficult).
- Score tracking.
- Game-over screen.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Compile the code** using a C++ compiler.
3. **Execute the compiled executable** to start the game.
4. Use arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake.
    - Up Arrow: Move Up
    - Down Arrow: Move Down
    - Left Arrow: Move Left
    - Right Arrow: Move Right
5. Press `1` for difficult mode or `2` for easy mode.
   - Difficult Mode: Faster snake movement (30ms delay).
   - Easy Mode: Slower snake movement (100ms delay).
6. The game continues until you collide with borders or the snake's tail.
